This project aims to predict whether a student will get placed or not, based on 'Placement Data'. The data used is a small dummy data comprising of 215 rows and 14 columns like intermediate percentage, intermediate board, degree, degree percentage etc. 

I loaded the dataset, checked and treated its missing values, cleaned and restructured the data. I used the label encoding technique to encode the categorical values & then standardized and normalized the data, hence making it ready for the modelling part.

I've applied K-Nearest Neighbor as my base model. Not satisfied with the accuracy I achieved, I've further applied multiple classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier. Finally, I achieved the highest accuracy of 100% with Gradient Boost Method.
